  PingBypass
</h1>

:warning: **Warning**  
This Version of PingBypass does not have any actual PingBypass functionality yet.
I am releasing it because I use it as a base to run [Phobot](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/Phobot).
Since Phobot is my last mc project I do not think I am going to maintain this for long.
For a 1.12.2 PingBypass see [3arthh4ck](https://github.com/3arthqu4ke/3arthh4ck).
